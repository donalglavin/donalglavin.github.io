title: Creating Your Very Own Hugo Website.

# Introduction. 

Having a website is one of those things that a lot of people talk about but not everyone actually ever does. 
With the power of Hugo and GitHub Pages the usual challenges of: **How to I get a domain and put it on the Internet?**
And **It seems like so much work...** Essentially boil down to just a learning curve that although it seems steep at the
start becomes almost trivial once you've got the hand of it. 

Within this post (although please consider it a work in progress) I will break down how you can go about creating your
own website for free and customise it to your liking.

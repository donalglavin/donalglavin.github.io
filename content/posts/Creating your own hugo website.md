## Introduction. 

Having a website is one of those things that a lot of people talk about but not everyone actually ever does and is often
considered to be a very technically challenging idea with people unsure of where to start.

Fortunately, with tools like Hugo and GitHub pages the usual challenges of: 
- **Do I actually need to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript file to make a website?** 
- **How to I actually get this file on the Internet so others can see it?** 
- **Do I really need to update all of this mark-up every time I want to change something?** 

Essentially boil down to the following steps ticking off each of the following steps: 
1. Understanding YAML which is essentially a specially formatted text file called a mark-up language (not really a
   language but it's called that).
1. Learning a bit of git which can actually be a fairly complex topic and can be a little overwhelming to start off with. 
   Luckily there is a only a very small portion that you need to understand for a personal website (that I'm assuming only you will
   be working on) which involve pulling and pushing to remote repositories. Plus there a some pretty useful tools to
   help.
1. Learning markdown (Almost the same as YAML in the fact that it's just a text file with a few special characters.
1. And of course, any sort of development wouldn't be complete without a little copy and paste.

Once you've managed to get up to speed with this, you can start dipping your toes in HTML, CSS and JavaScript (if you
want but also completely not required).

Keep this up for a little bit and before you know it, updating and adding content to your site will become trivial. 

Within this post (although please consider it a work in progress) 
I will break down how you can go about creating your own website for free and customise it to your liking. 

## Color Palette. 

The color palette I chose for this website aimed to, simple, stylish and not to hard on the eyes. 
I chose a blue-grey mix as grey works in well to add contrast with a black and white document whilst 
blue adds a little bit of color to the mix also. 

The hex codes below represent that of the primary colors throughout the site:
<div style="background-color:#263238;color:white;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;">#263238</div>
<div style="background-color:#37474f;color:white;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;">#37474f</div>
<div style="background-color:#455a64;color:white;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;">#455a64</div>
<div style="background-color:#546e7a;color:white;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;">#546e7a</div>
<div style="background-color:#607d8b;color:white;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;">#607d8b</div>
<div style="background-color:#78909c;color:black;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;">#78909c</div>
<div style="background-color:#90a4ae;color:black;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;">#90a4ae</div>
<div style="background-color:#b0bec5;color:black;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;">#b0bec5</div>
<div style="background-color:#cfd8dc;color:black;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;">#cfd8dc</div>
<div style="background-color:#eceff1;color:black;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;">#eceff1</div>

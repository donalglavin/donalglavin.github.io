G'Day! 👋

I'm a Senior Mechanical Engineer currently working on a Copper and Gold mine here in sunny Queensland, Australia. 
While I'm formally trained in Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics, I've always had a soft spot for software development and programming.

I created this website to share some of the projects I've been working on, as well as my general interests and things I've learned along the way. 
Hopefully, it'll spark some ideas for you or even help you out with your own projects! 🚀

Here's what I'm mainly into:

- **Finance:** Both fundamental and technical analysis, especially using statistics and machine learning to uncover profitable insights. 📈
- **Numerical Modeling:** I love diving into the worlds of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), discrete element methods (DEM), and finite element analysis (FEA). ⚙️
- **Data Analysis and Analytics:** I'm always looking for ways to crunch numbers and find patterns, particularly in finance and real estate. 📊
- **Scripting:** Automation with the objective of making my life a little easier with the focus of repetitive things I don't like doing. 🤖

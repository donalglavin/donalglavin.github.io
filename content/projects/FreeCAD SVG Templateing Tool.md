# Introduction. 
FreeCAD, at the time of writing, and in my opinion, is the most production ready open source alternative to commercial
parametric modelling software available to the public. 

The open source nature of the program allows individuals to freely use, modify, contribute two and commercially benefit
without any requirements for purchasing expensive Licences.

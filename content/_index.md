## G'Day & Welcome 👋.
This is my personal website which consists of a collection of blog posts, projects, tutorials, work and ideas from my
professional life interests and hobbies that I hope will help you in some aspect of your either your hobbies or work.
 
The links below are connected through to Medium, a site that aids in the monetization of story telling allowing
people to share the life lessons and get paid for people reading them. 

Feel free to sign up to Medium as it opens you up to a huge amount of resources and your membership frees are used to
fund the composition of more posts and stories.

You still get some access for free to Medium so feel free to have a browse and let me know if there's anything you'd
like me to explore or elaborate on. I'm open to requests, happy reading!

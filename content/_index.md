## G'Day & Welcome ðŸ‘‹.
This is my personal website which consists of a collection of posts, personal projects, tutorials, ideas from my
professional life, interests and hobbies! 

Hopefully you'll find something in there that will help you in some way shape or form!
 
Some of the links on this site are connected through to Medium. Which is a platform that helps people (like me) who want to
share their ideas, and things they've learned and with others and earn a little bit of money on the side to fund future projects
(mainly through adds).

Feel free to sign up to Medium, as it opens you up to a huge amount of resources and your membership fees are used to
fund the people writing on the platform make of more posts that interest you.

You still get some access for free to Medium so have a browse and let me know if there's anything you'd
like me to explore or elaborate on. 

I'm open to requests and I'm also doing freelance work at the moment so feel free to reach out and of course, happy reading!

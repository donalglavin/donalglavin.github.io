Gold operations in both the Northern Territory and Queensland.</p><p>While my formal training includes a Duel Bachelors of Engineering (Honours) and Bachelors of Science majoring in Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics from James Cook
University and more recently a Graduate Diploma of Finance from Griffith University,</p><p>I&rsquo;ve always had a passion for software development, data analysis, and programming. I created this website to share some
of the projects I&rsquo;ve been working on, as well as my general interests and things I&rsquo;ve learned along the way.</p><p>My hope is, it&rsquo;ll spark some ideas for you <em>(the reader)</em> or help you out with one of your own current projects!</p><h2 id=finance>Finance</h2><p>Since completing my Graduate Diploma in finance I developed a substantial interest into both fundamental and technical analysis associated with trading assets.</p><p>Although, engineering and finance work well together when considering project costing, net present value and communicating with the business to justify capital expenditure.</p><p>My personal passion lies primarily in the statistics and machine learning aspects of forecasting markets and asset values into the future.
Something which is notoriously difficult (verging on impossible even today) whilst being highly qualified professionals
full time job.</p><p>This interest is aimed towards the faint hope to be able retire early. (I don&rsquo;t like my chances however, I&rsquo;ll keep you posted..)</p><h2 id=analytics--numerical-modeling>Analytics & Numerical Modeling.</h2><p>I know I&rsquo;m the odd one out, but I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed Mathematics <em>(to the extent that I extended my degree a year to get a
major in it)</em></p><p>Understanding how the analytic expressions can be used to describe the world around us. Along with the numerical and
computational processes involved in breaking them down into a language a computer understands is a process that, still
now, over 12 years after starting university, still blows my mind!</p><p>I love diving into the worlds of computational fluid dynamics, discrete element methods, and finite element analysis.</p><h2 id=statistics-machine-learning--data-analysis>Statistics, Machine Learning & Data Analysis.</h2><p>Ever since completing my first statistics course in
I&rsquo;m always looking for ways to crunch numbers and find patterns, particularly in finance and real estate.</p><h2 id=automation--software>Automation & Software.</h2><p>I&rsquo;m a firm believer that <span style=text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-thickness:1px>the difference between a good and a great tradesman is,
one never blames his tools, and the other makes their own.</span></p><p>In this context the difference is an engineers tooling more generally exists in software whilst a tradesman&rsquo;s tools are more often than not hardware.</p><p>My objective with automation and software, is to be a not just a <strong>good</strong> engineer but a <strong>great</strong> one.
By learning to make my own tools that solve the problems I face through my career while also accelerating my work output.</p><h2 id=disclaimer>Disclaimer.</h2><p>Feel free to copy and use anything you find on this site however, I can&rsquo;t and don&rsquo;t offer any warranties or take
